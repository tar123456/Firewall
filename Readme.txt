**Project Overview:**
- Project Name: Firewall
- Description: It is a 3D arcade shooter. I took inspiration for the Nier Automata's Hacking minigame. Here are the controls: WASD - movement, E - Shoot, Mouse - Look around

1. Execution Method:
   - Environment: Used the Unity engine for the development 
   - How to Run:  
**Step 1: Extract Project Files**
1. Extract the project files from the provided archive to a location on your computer.

**Step 2: Open Unity Hub**
1. Launch Unity Hub if you have it installed.
2. If you don't have Unity Hub, you can download and install it from the Unity website.
3. Open Unity Hub.

**Step 3: Add Project to Unity Hub**
1. In Unity Hub, click the "Add" button.
2. Browse to the project files folder that you extracted earlier.
3. Select the project folder and click "Open."

**Running the Prebuilt Version of the Game:**

**Step 1: Navigate to Builds Folder**
1. Go to the "builds" folder within the project directory.

**Step 2: Run the Game (Windows)**
1. Locate and run the "firewall.exe" file to play the prebuilt version of the game.

**Running the Project on Android:**

**Step 1: Access Android Builds**

1. Move the APK file from the "Android builds" folder to your Android device.
2. Install the project by locating the APK file on your device.
3. Note: If prompted, and Google Play prevents the installation, choose to install anyway.




2. Areas of Struggle:
During the development of this program, I encountered several challenges that tested my problem-solving and development skills. Notable challenges included:

Wave System Development: One of the major hurdles I faced was in developing the game's wave system and effectively managing it. This task required the implementation of the observer pattern, which posed a significant challenge due to its
intricacies.

Score Management in Wave Manager: Specifically, managing the scoring system within the wave manager proved to be a complex task. It took several hours of diligent effort to identify and resolve issues, ensuring that the scoring system functioned 
correctly.

These challenges were valuable learning experiences that allowed me to enhance my proficiency in game development and problem-solving.



3. Area of Special Focus:
   One aspect of this program I'd like you to pay particular attention to is:
   Wave System Development: The development of the game's wave system and the effective utilization of the observer pattern presented significant hurdles. Understanding how these challenges were tackled and the resulting solutions can provide
   insights into my problem-solving and development abilities. By focusing on these aspects, you will gain a deeper understanding of my skills and dedication to overcoming complex programming challenges.

4. Source Files for Reference:
    During the development process, I primarily utilized the Unity engine as the foundational tool for creating this game. The Unity engine provides a versatile framework that allowed me to implement various game mechanics and features effectively.

    While the project itself did not rely heavily on external source files, the Unity documentation and resources were invaluable references in understanding and leveraging the engine's capabilities. My ability to harness the power of Unity demonstrates 
     my proficiency in using industry-standard tools for game development.
